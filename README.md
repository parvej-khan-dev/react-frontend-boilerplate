# React Frontend Application

Welcome to the React Frontend Application! This project is based on a simplified structure, eliminating the need for routing, complex layouts, and Redux for state management. It provides a quick starting point for your React projects.

## Getting Started

Follow these simple steps to set up and run the application:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/parvej-khan-dev/react-frontend-boilerplate.git
   ```


2.Change to the project directory:
```bash
cd react-frontend-boilerplate
```

3. Optionally, rename the folder/project:

4.If you renamed the folder, make sure to delete the existing .git file:

```bash
rm -rf .git

```

5.Install dependencies:

```bash

```

6.Run the development server:
